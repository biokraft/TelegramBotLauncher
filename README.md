# What to do with this?

This small programm simply is supposed to aid everyone who would like to have a TelegramBot for his group/supergroup to help him/her manage spam, new users, commands (still need to do this) and even more. Basically my goal is to make it super easy to set up a working telegram bot.

# Working features:
**Please set your bot privacy to disabled, for all this to work properly and give the bot admin rights**

* 0.1.0 - Anti-URL-Spam
    * 0.1.0 - do not delete URLs if the person has been part of the group for more than 7 days
    * 0.1.5 - give feedback to the spammer
* 0.1.0 - Greet new members
    * 0.1.0 - set the greeting text yourself
    * 0.2.3 - greeting text will disappear after 10 sec
* 0.2.0 - Post your latest tweet by typing /tweet **<- (currently not working)**
* 0.2.4 - Set up all your desired commands in command.data like this:  [example](https://pastebin.com/Z0pK1E36)
