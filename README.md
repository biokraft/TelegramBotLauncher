This is my small hobby project that I'm doing while learning java and programming in general. I started studying Informatics Games Engineering in Oct. 2017 and fucked up my programming classes. Thats why I thought why not programm something to enhance my skills and keep on practicing üëç 

Feel free to shoot me any tips or tricks on telegram at @eigenbedarf
I'm still learning so bare with me if my code is not readable or badly structured. I'm always open for advices! Feel free to tell me anything that you would do better or would suggest that I'd change. I'm very keen on learning to be a better programmer!

# What to do with this?

This small programm simply is supposed to aid everyone who would like to have a TelegramBot for his group/supergroup to help him/her manage spam, new users, commands (still need to do this) and even more. Basically my goal is to make it super easy to set up a working telegram bot.

# Working features:
* Anti-URL-Spam
    * give feedback to the spammer
    * do not delete URLs if the person has been part of the group for more than 7 days
* Greet new members
    * set the greeting text yourself
* Post your latest tweet by typing /tweet
